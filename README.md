## My Process:

I like to start with a **rough sketch** or idea of what I want the site to look like. Then, I like to build sites piece by piece, from the header to the footer. I try many formats; whenever I see something that works, I save it in my notepad and keep trying other layouts. In the end, I go with the one that most importantly works, and I am able to change and modify it to suit my needs. The biggest challenge I faced was deciding on how to display the images on the site. After getting frustrated, I decided to settle for a tried and true grid. I also had to resize all my images because they were too large. By creating my portfolio, I learned how to use the A.O.S (Animate On Scroll) library. It produces smooth animations with little to no work on my end.
